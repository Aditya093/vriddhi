    "fertilizers": "Fertilizers should be applied before planting and during the growing season. Nitrogen should be applied in split doses to avoid excessive vegetative growth and delay fruit maturity.",
    "intercultural operation": "Inter-cultivation is important to control weeds and maintain soil moisture. Cultivation should be done shallowly to avoid root damage, and hoeing should be done when the soil is dry to prevent soil compaction.",
    "weeding": "Watermelon is sensitive to competition from weeds, and timely weeding is necessary to prevent yield losses. Hand weeding or mechanical methods can be used to control weeds.",
    "re-planting or under-planting": "Watermelon can be intercropped with legumes, vegetables, or cereals to maximize land use and improve soil health. Replanting can be done after the harvest of the previous crop.",
    "nutritional deficiencies and their management": "Common nutritional deficiencies in watermelon include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These deficiencies can be managed by applying appropriate fertilizers, compost, or manure. Foliar sprays can also be used to supplement nutrients."

    "crop": "wheat",
    "introduction": "Wheat is a cereal crop that is widely cultivated for its edible grains. It is the most important staple food crop in many parts of the world and is used to make various food products such as bread, pasta, and noodles.",
    "growth climate": "Wheat grows best in cool and temperate climates with temperatures between 15-20°C. The crop requires moderate rainfall of around 50-75 cm per year, and the soil should be well-drained and fertile.",
    "soil": "Wheat can be grown in a wide range of soil types but performs best in well-drained loamy soils with a pH between 6.0-7.5. The soil should be rich in organic matter and have adequate nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.",
    "Varieties recommended": "Some popular wheat varieties recommended include Durum, Hard Red Spring, Soft Red Winter, and Hard White. These varieties are known for their high yield, good quality, and resistance to diseases.",
    "Sowing and seed planting": "Wheat seeds are sown in the fall or spring seasons depending on the variety and climatic conditions. The seeds are drilled into the soil at a depth of 2-3 cm and spaced at 15-20 cm apart.",
    "method of planting": "The seeds are planted in rows using a seed drill or broadcasted onto the soil surface and then covered with soil. The planting method depends on the variety and soil conditions.",
    "young palms": "Young wheat plants require adequate water and nutrients to establish and grow. Irrigation is necessary during the early stages of growth, and the plants should be protected from pests and diseases.",
    "land preparation": "The land should be prepared by plowing, harrowing, and leveling to create a fine seedbed. Organic matter and fertilizers should be added to the soil to enhance soil fertility and nutrient availability.",
    "spacing": "Wheat plants should be spaced at 15-20 cm apart in rows, and the rows should be spaced at 20-25 cm apart. This spacing ensures adequate room for growth and good airflow around the plants.",
    "manuring": "Wheat requires a balanced supply of nutrients for optimum growth and yield. Manure, compost, and chemical fertilizers can be used to meet the nutrient requirements of the crop. The recommended dose of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is 120:60:40 kg per hectare.",
    "fertilizers": "Fertilizers should be applied before planting and during the growing season. Nitrogen should be applied in split doses to avoid excessive vegetative growth and delay grain filling.",
    "intercultural operation": "Inter-cultivation is important to control weeds and maintain soil moisture. Cultivation should be done shallowly to avoid root damage, and hoeing should be done when the soil is dry to prevent soil compaction.",
    "weeding": "Weeds compete with wheat for nutrients and water, and timely weeding is necessary to prevent yield losses. Hand weeding or mechanical methods can be used to control weeds.",
    "re-planting or under-planting": "Wheat can be intercropped with legumes, vegetables, or cereals to maximize land use and improve soil health. Replanting can be done after the harvest of the previous crop.",
    "nutritional deficiencies and their management": "Common nutritional deficiencies in wheat include nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. These deficiencies can be managed by applying appropriate fertilizers, compost, or manure."
