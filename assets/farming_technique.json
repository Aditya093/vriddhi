    "description": "Vermiculture, also known as worm farming or vermicomposting, is a technique that utilizes earthworms to convert organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. It involves creating a controlled environment where earthworms break down organic matter, such as kitchen scraps, garden waste, and agricultural residues, into vermicompost—a nutrient-rich soil amendment. Vermiculture not only helps in waste management and recycling but also produces high-quality compost that improves soil fertility and promotes healthy plant growth.",
