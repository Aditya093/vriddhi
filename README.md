# Vriddhi

A next generation farming application which optimizes the efforts of farmers to gain an optimist yield from their production

## Abstract

Agriculture is one of the most fundamental aspects of human life. Agriculture has developed with human evolution. 
'Vriddhi' is a solution to the challenges that many farmers confront all over the world.
'Vriddhi' offers capabilities for the advanced farming revolution. 
Farmers can use 'Vriddhi' to acquire agricultural production recommendations based on soil, climate, seeds, fertilisers, and other factors. 
Farmers can examine crop demand at several market locations to determine the best location to sell their harvest.
 Farmers may learn about new agricultural practices and keep up to date by getting suggestions. 
Farmers can also apply for government insurance and other programmes. Weather and crop prediction tools will assist farmers in determining the optimum crop to plant and in maintaining that crop on a regular basis. 
Farmers may send out reminders to remind them of fertiliser and water dispersion, as well as other agricultural activities. 
A comprehensive real-time dashboard will be given for recording, tracking, and viewing detailed crop statistics, status, and marketing operations.
Planting guide creation capability allows Farmers to design efficient planting guides for on-field personnel and also print them for convenience. 

## Problems with current Agriculture world

Soil degradation: Soil degradation is a major problem in agriculture, particularly in areas where intensive farming practices have been used. Overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, as well as erosion caused by deforestation and land-use change, can lead to soil degradation and reduce crop yields.

Pests and diseases: Pests and diseases can have a significant impact on crop yields and livestock production. Climate change has also led to the emergence of new pests and diseases, which can be challenging for farmers to control.

Market access: Access to markets and fair prices for their products is a challenge for many farmers, particularly small-scale farmers. They may lack the infrastructure and resources to transport their products to markets or may be forced to sell their products at low prices to intermediaries.

Water scarcity: Water scarcity is a significant problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with low rainfall or high rates of evaporation. As agriculture is one of the largest consumers of water, farmers often struggle to obtain enough water to irrigate their crops and support their livestock.
